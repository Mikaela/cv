## Versioning

Due to having two different language versions, I need to be aware which state
particular version is to keep them in sync, I have decided to  use [CalVer](https://calver.org/)
format `YYYY.0W.MICRO` (year.week.numberofEdit e.g. `2022.01.00`).

Additionally more human readable date is provided for convenience of the
reader for when I have made changes or confirmed the CV to still be
up-to-date.

Internally both of these are provided in the YAML front matter and refer to
variable on the bottom of the page.
